# Project Assistant

This is a **generic Claude Code configuration** designed to work in any repository.

## First-Time Setup

Run the `/setup-claude` command to analyze your repository and customize this folder for your specific project. The setup command will:

- Detect your tech stack and project type
- Create a customized CLAUDE.md with project-specific context
- Generate domain-specific skills if needed
- Configure build/test hooks appropriately

## Available Commands

### Core Workflow

- `/plan` - Create a strategic plan (generates task_plan.md using planning-with-files pattern)
- `/review` - Comprehensive code review with security and quality checks
- `/update-context` - Save current state before running /clear (context management)

### Pattern Guidance

- `/guide` - Get pattern recommendations for your scenario (Vanilla/Planning-with-Files/SuperClaude)

### Meta Commands

- `/setup-claude` - Analyze repository and customize this .claude folder
- `/create-skill` - Create a new custom skill for your project

## Skills

This folder includes generic skills that work across any tech stack:

- **code-quality** - DRY, SOLID principles, error handling patterns
- **testing** - Framework-agnostic test writing guidance
- **security** - OWASP top 10, input validation, secure coding
- **git-workflow** - Commit messages, branching strategies
- **documentation** - Clear documentation and code comments
- **pattern-guide** - Guidance on choosing and applying Claude Code patterns (NEW!)
- **skill-creator** - Create new skills using Anthropic's pattern

Skills auto-activate based on your prompts. The hooks will suggest relevant skills when detected.

**New**: The `pattern-guide` skill helps you choose between Vanilla Claude Code, Planning-with-Files, and SuperClaude patterns based on your task complexity. It auto-activates when you ask about approaches or workflows.

## Hooks

This folder includes hooks that guide you to follow best practices:

- **skill-activation** - Suggests relevant skills based on your prompt
- **planning-reminder** - Reminds you to create a plan before implementing
- **context-check** - Suggests /update-context after 50 tool calls
- **build-check** - Runs build after edits (if build script exists)

## Subagents

Specialized agents for complex tasks:

- **code-reviewer** - Systematic code review following comprehensive checklist
- **setup-assistant** - Helps with initial repository setup and analysis
- **pattern-guide** - Teaches you the patterns as you work

## Coding Rules

Until customized by `/setup-claude`, follow these universal principles:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Apply SOLID principles
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Write self-documenting code

2. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Maintain existing test coverage
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

3. **Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Never trust user data
   - Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Use parameterized queries

4. **Git Workflow**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Keep commits atomic and focused
   - Follow conventional commits format

## Getting Started

1. **First time?** Run `/setup-claude` to customize this folder
2. **Not sure which pattern to use?** Run `/guide` to get recommendations (NEW!)
3. **Starting new work?** Run `/plan` to create a strategic plan
4. **Need review?** Run `/review` before committing
5. **Long session?** Run `/update-context` every ~50 tool calls, then /clear

### Pattern Guidance System (NEW!)

Not sure whether to use Vanilla, Planning-with-Files, or SuperClaude patterns?

**Three ways to get guidance:**

1. **Quick recommendation**: Run `/guide` and describe your task
2. **Auto-activation**: The `pattern-guide` skill suggests patterns as you work
3. **Deep learning**: Ask to spawn the `pattern-guide` subagent for comprehensive teaching

**Example**:

- You: "I need to add authentication to my app"
- Run: `/guide`
- Get: Recommended pattern + step-by-step instructions

## Learning Mode

The hooks in this folder will guide you to follow patterns from:

- Vanilla Claude Code (commands, skills, hooks, subagents)
- Planning-with-files plugin (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
- SuperClaude framework (agents, modes, advanced workflows)

As you work, you'll receive suggestions to help you learn and apply these patterns effectively.

**Note**: This is a bootstrap configuration. Run `/setup-claude` to make it specific to your project.
