## Key Questions
1. Should team photos use initials or generic icons? (Decision: Initials for personalization)
2. How many values cards? (Decision: 3-4 cards)
3. What placeholder names for team? (Decision: Rajesh Kumar - MD, Sanjay Sharma - CEO)
4. Should we include company timeline? (Decision: No, keep it simple)

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use same navigation from homepage | Ensures consistency across site |
| 3-4 values cards | Keeps section focused and scannable |
| Circular SVG avatars with initials | Professional, easy to replace with photos |
| Placeholder names (Rajesh Kumar, Sanjay Sharma) | Provides realistic preview, can be updated |
| No timeline section | Keeps page focused, avoid over-engineering |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes
- Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
- Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
- Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
- Reference websites already fetched in previous conversation context
