# Research Findings: Lubricants Page

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01
**Phase:** Research & Discovery

## Quick Reference

### Key Insight
Crusher lubrication varies by crusher type (jaw, cone, impact). Jaw crushers primarily use grease, cone crushers use circulating oil, and all types need extreme pressure (EP) additives for heavy-load protection. Temperature resistance (350°F+) and viscosity grades (ISO VG 100-680) are critical.

### Product Categories
1. **Crusher Oils** (ISO 100, ISO 150) - Circulating lubrication for cone crushers, gearboxes
2. **EP Greases** (NLGI Grade 2, lithium-complex) - Bearings, toggle points, gap control threads
3. **Hydraulic Oils** (ISO VG 32-68) - Gap control systems, hydraulic adjustments
4. **Specialty Greases** (with MoS2) - High-temperature, heavy-shock applications

### Technical Specifications
- **Grease:** NLGI Grade 2, lithium or calcium base, ISO VG 220-680 base oil, dropping point >350°F
- **Oil:** ISO VG 100-150 for circulatory systems, AGMA 3-4 EP for gears

- **Toggle Systems:** Pivot points, connection joints (jaw crushers)

#### **Maintenance Best Practices**

**Five Key Principles:**

1. **Keep Systems Clean**
   - **Critical:** Clean lube oil is the #1 factor affecting component service life
   - **Problem:** Rock dust contamination from neglected maintenance
   - **Solution:** Regular cleaning, sealed systems, proper filtration

2. **Use Proper Lubricants**
   - Follow manufacturer specifications for viscosity grade and type
   - Use high-temperature greases with EP additives for crushers
   - Ensure lubricants are contamination-free before application

3. **Monitor Oil Temperature**
   - **Optimal Range:** 100-130°F (38-54°C)
   - **Acceptable Range:** 60-140°F (15-60°C)
   - Overheating indicates excessive load or inadequate lubrication

4. **Oil Analysis Programs**
   - **Frequency:** Monthly or every 200 operating hours
   - **Five Key Tests:**
     1. Viscosity (fluid thickness)
     2. Oxidation (degradation level)
     3. Water content (contamination)
     4. Particle counts (wear debris)
     5. Machine-wear (metal content)

5. **Pressure Monitoring**
   - **Typical HP crushers:** 35-50 PSI (varies by size)
   - Low pressure indicates: worn pump, faulty relief valve, or excessive bearing clearances

**Maintenance Schedule:**

| Frequency | Tasks |
|-----------|-------|
| **Daily** | Check fluid levels, oil pressures, leaks; lubricate moving parts |
| **Weekly** | Follow detailed lubrication schedule per manufacturer specs |
| **Every 8 hrs** | Replenish grease (varies by model and operating conditions) |
| **Monthly** | Check gearbox oil level, grease sliding surfaces/tensioners/rollers/bearings; take oil sample for analysis |
| **Every 1000 hrs** | Replace breather filters (clean daily between replacements) |

**Common Problems & Solutions:**

| Problem | Causes | Solutions |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Overheating** | Excessive load, inadequate lubrication, blocked cooling | Check lube levels, monitor loads, inspect cooling systems |
| **Low Oil Pressure** | Worn pump, faulty relief valve, excessive bearing clearance | Replace pump, inspect valve, measure bearing clearances |
| **Contaminated Return Screen** | Failed seals, high wear, machine failure | Replace seals, inspect wear surfaces, full machine inspection |
| **Excessive Vibration** | Imbalanced components, worn bearings/bushings | Balance rotors, replace bearings, realign components |
