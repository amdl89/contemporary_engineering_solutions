1. **High Efficiency & Capacity:**
   - Process large tonnages at efficient operational cost
   - Output up to 2,181 TPH (more than double jaw crusher capacity)
   - Handle high production rates for mining and aggregate operations

2. **Product Quality:**
   - High content of cubic material in finished product
   - Consistent output size
   - Better particle shape for aggregates and manufactured sand

3. **Operational Benefits:**
   - Low operating costs per ton
   - Handles abrasive materials well
   - Automation improves performance from 75% to 75-90% of peak
   - Fast mantle rotation reduces operational costs

4. **Versatility:**
   - Suitable for hard, abrasive materials (gold, copper, iron, diamond ores)
   - Multiple crushing stages (secondary through quaternary)
   - Ideal for sized aggregates (10mm, 20mm, 40mm) requiring cubicity

**Applications:**

#### Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: When to Use Each

**Crushing Stage:**
- **Jaw:** Primary crushing (first stage, coarse reduction of large run-of-mine rock)
- **Cone:** Secondary/tertiary crushing (refines pre-crushed material for finer output)

**Feed Size:**
- **Jaw:** Large feed size range (up to 1,200mm)
- **Cone:** Smaller feed size (generally <450mm, requires pre-crushing)

**Output:**
- **Jaw:** Coarse output (50-20" on average)
- **Cone:** Fine, cubical output with consistent gradation

**Working Principle:**
- **Jaw:** Compressive force between fixed and moving jaw plates (elliptical motion)
- **Cone:** Gyration and compression (rotating mantle inside stationary concave)

**Capacity:**
- **Jaw:** Lower capacity (suitable for primary stage)
- **Cone:** Higher capacity (up to 2,181 TPH, more than double jaw crusher)

**Cost:**
- **Jaw:** Lower initial purchase price
- **Cone:** Higher initial cost, but lower operating cost per ton due to efficiency

**Product Quality:**
- **Jaw:** Produces variable particle shapes
- **Cone:** Produces high content of cubic material (critical for concrete and asphalt)

**Partnership, Not Competition:**
"The jaw crusher performs the primary crushing that the cone cannot, while the cone crusher performs the secondary crushing and shaping that the jaw cannot. They are not competitors; they are partners in a system."

**When to Use Both:**
Essential when selling sized aggregates (10mm, 20mm, 40mm) for concrete batching plants or asphalt production where cubicity and gradation are critical.
